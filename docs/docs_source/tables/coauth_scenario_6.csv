Application,PutFile access token used,Additional notes
Word Online,"Either access token may be used, depending on which user changed the document most recently during the auto-save interval.","If a PutFile request is made using User A's access token, it will fail, and all users, including User B, will be kicked out of the editing session. If PutFile is never called with User A's access token, then after no more than 5 minutes, Office Online will call CheckFileInfo with User A's access token. That call will indicate that User A no longer has edit permissions, so User A will be kicked out of the editing session. User B can continue editing the document."
Excel Online,User A,"Once User A's edit permission is removed, all PutFile requests for the session will fail. In no more than 3 minutes after the first PutFile failure, then all users, including User B, will be kicked out of the editing session."
